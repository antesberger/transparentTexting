# transparentTexting

ToDo:

Design 
- text color -> DONE
- bubble design -> DONE
- standard bubbles -> DONE

Implementation
- transparent Background -> DONE

Logging
- extra db or Firebase?
- text errors

- id
- text speed: durchschnittliche Dauer zwischen 2 TastenangschlÃ¤gen -> bei tastenanschlag client side in array speichern
- walking speed possible (GPS)? -> manuell messen?
- phone orientation (how to implement)? -> kontinuierlich ca. alle 0.3s


Group discussion:
 - different settings (autocorrect) for each user or default?

Prestudy
- Reason: We need to make sure that the result don't only depend on our design decisions (apple-like text bubbles vs. transparent text bubbles vs. white text with black outline) but the general concept of transparent texting.
- have the designs as independent variable and conduct a within between subject design prestudy
- randomize the order of the conditions
- Test user experience and/or performance
- 15 to 20 subjects
- have a good argument for a better grade in the end :)

Other possible options:
- just use the standard bubble design of apple because its comparable to the control experiment and state that the results might difer for different designs
- use the transparent bubble design and come up with a good argumentation why we did it (in our opinion not the best choice because it will look weak in the end)
- use the 3 different designs as additional independent variables and have a HUGE experiment

TODO:
- username datenbank
- logging in datenbank
- vorbereitung prestudy (-> install all apps on phone) TESTING

Mini summary:
- Steps: Acquired basic skills in the programming language Swift and ios programming in general -> discussed programming and design challenges -> considered a rough basic structure of the app
- Tools: Xcode (IDE), Firebase (mobile & web application development platform) and MySQL database to save data, Swift & PHP as programming language
- Implementation: implemented a real-time chat app using the Firebase framework to synchronize real time data, implemented transparent background, 
- Design: We have considered three different speech bubble designs: We have adapted to the basic design guidlines of apple and have changed small things regarding the text color, text bubbles design etc.
